Here are my reasons:\\r\\nFirst - she as a person made me feel super welcome. I requested her a really early check in and she agreed (which was helpful because I took a red eye from Seattle). She also allowed me to keep my bags after my check out time so I could pick it up before my flight.\\r\\nSecond - her apartment location is SUPER convenient. Right next to the #1 and pretty close to B and C lines. NYC is all about location is this fits perfectly.\\r\\nThird - her apartment gives the feel of a typical NYC apartment. It is tiny but has everything you need. Two beds, a great shower, clean towels, and a kitchen (which I didn't use). Safe building with elevator. \\r\\n\\r\\nI would totally stay here again.  \"}, {'_id': '31196460', 'date': '2015-05-03 04:00:00', 'listing_id': '1003530', 'reviewer_id': '43102', 'reviewer_name': 'Catherine Et Albert', 'comments': \"Greta was a fantastic host, we had a problem with a lost luggage at JFK and she helped us to coordinate the delivery.
